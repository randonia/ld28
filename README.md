This is my code base for Ludum Dare 28. I'll try my best to publish here as 
frequently as possible.

This project is (stupidly) in C++ using SFML. The code base is set up to use 
Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop.

This game unfortunately requires Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012
